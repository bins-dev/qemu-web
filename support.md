If you have a support question that is not answered by our
[documentation](/documentation) you have a number of options available
to you.

If the question is specifically about the integration of QEMU with the
rest of your Linux distribution you may be better served by asking
through your distribution's support channels. This includes questions
about a specifically packaged version of QEMU. The QEMU developers are
generally concerned with the latest release and the current state of
the [master branch](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu) and do not
provide support for older releases or QEMU binaries shipped by third
party distributions.

Questions about complex configurations of networking and storage are
usually met with a recommendation to use management tools like
[virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/) from the [libvirt
project](https://libvirt.org/) to configure and run QEMU. Management
tools handle the low-level details of setting up devices that most
users should not need to learn.

To get in touch with the people from the QEMU project, you have the
following options:

* There is a
[qemu-discuss@nongnu.org](https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/qemu-discuss)
mailing list for user focused questions.<br>
If your question is more technical or architecture specific you may
want to send your question to another of [QEMU's mailing
lists](https://wiki.qemu.org/MailingLists)

* A lot of developers hang around on IRC (network: irc.oftc.net,
channel #qemu, also available via
[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#_oftc_#qemu:matrix.org)).<br> QEMU
developers tend to be available on working week days and are distributed around
the world across all time zones. Please be patient as you may have to stay
connected and wait for a response. If you can't leave IRC open and wait you may
also seek help in a mailing list.

* If you think you have found a bug you can report it on [our bug
  tracker](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues).<br/>
Please see our guide on [how to report a bug](/contribute/report-a-bug/)
