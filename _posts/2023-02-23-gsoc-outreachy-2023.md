QEMU is participating in [Google Summer of
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and
[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) again this year! Google Summer of Code
and Outreachy are open source internship programs that offer paid remote work
opportunities for contributing to open source. Internships generally run May
through August, so if you have time and want to experience open source
development, read on to find out how you can apply.

Each intern is paired with one or more mentors, experienced QEMU contributors
who support them during the internship. Code developed by the intern is
submitted through the same open source development process that all QEMU
contributions follow. This gives interns experience with contributing to open
source software. Some interns then choose to pursue a career in open source
software after completing their internship.

## Find out if you are eligible
Information on who can apply is
[here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation)
for Google Summer of Code and [here](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/) for
Outreachy. Note that Outreachy initial applications ended on February 6th so
only those who have been accepted into Outreachy can apply for QEMU Outreachy
internships.

## Select a project idea
Look through the the [list of QEMU project
ideas](https://wiki.qemu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2023) and see if there is
something you are interested in working on. Once you have found a project idea
you want to apply for, email the mentor for that project idea to ask any
questions you may have and discuss the idea further.

## Submit your application
You can [apply for Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
from March 20th to April 4th and [apply for
Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/) from March 6th to April 3rd.

Good luck with your applications!
