Highlights include:

 * block: virtio-scsi multiqueue support for using different I/O threads to process requests for each queue (similar to the virtio-blk multiqueue support that was added in QEMU 9.2)
 * VFIO: improved support for IGD passthrough on all Intel Gen 11/12 devices
 * Documentation: significant improvement/overhaul of documentation for QEMU Machine Protocol to make it clearer and more organized, including all commands/events/types now being cross-reference-able via click-able links in generated documentation
 * ARM: emulation support for Secure EL2 physical and virtual timers
 * ARM: emulation support for FEAT_AFP, FEAT_RPRES, and FEAT_XS architecture features
 * ARM: new board models for NPCM8445 Evaluation and i.MX 8M Plus EVK boards
 * HPPA: new SeaBIOS-hppa version 18 with lots of fixes and enhancements
 * HPPA: translation speed and virtual CPU reset improvements
 * HPPA: emulation support for Diva GSP BMC boards
 * LoongArch: support for CPU hotplug, paravirtual IPIs, KVM steal time accounting, and virtual 'extioi' interrupt routing.
 * RISC-V: ISA/extension support for riscv-iommu-sys devices, 'svukte', 'ssstateen', 'smrnmi', 'smdbltrp'/'ssdbltrp', 'supm'/'sspm', and IOMMU translation tags
 * RISC-V: emulation support for Ascalon and RV64 Xiangshan Nanhu CPUs, and Microblaze V boards.
 * s390x: add CPU model support for the generation 17 mainframe CPU
 * s390x: add support for virtio-mem and for bypassing IOMMU to improve PCI device performance
 * x86: CPU model support for Clearwater Forest and Sierra Forest v2
 * x86: faster emulation of string instructions
 * and lots more...

Thank you to everybody who contributed to this release, whether that was by writing code, reporting bugs, improving documentation, testing, or providing the project with CI resources. We couldn't do these without you!
