[KVM Forum](https://kvm-forum.qemu.org/2023/) is an annual event that presents
a rare opportunity for KVM and QEMU developers and users to discuss the state
of Linux virtualization technology and plan for the challenges ahead. Sessions
include updates on the state of the KVM virtualization stack, planning for the
future, and many opportunities for attendees to collaborate.

This year's event will be held in Brno, Czech Republic on June 14-15, 2023.
It will be in-person only and will be held right before the
[DevConf.CZ](https://www.devconf.info/cz/) open source community conference.

June 14 will be at least partly dedicated to a hackathon or "day of BoFs".
This will provide time for people to get together and discuss strategic
decisions, as well as other topics that are best solved within smaller groups.
