Highlights include:

 * VFIO: Initial support for accessing/mapping memory for confidential guests when guest_memfd is being utilized, allowing passthrough support for virtual machines running under SEV-SNP/TDX
 * Live migration: support for utilizing multifd to accelerate post-copy migration, optimizations for pre-copy migration, and RDMA migration support for ipv6
 * QEMU guest agent: support for querying load of virtual machines running Windows via new 'guest-get-load' command
 * ARM: support for CPU features FEAT_SME2, FEAT_SME2p1, FEAT_SME_B16B16, FEAT_SME_F16F16, FEAT_SVE_B16B16, and FEAT_SVE2p1
 * ARM: support for new board/machine models 'max78000fthr', 'ast2700fc', 'catalina-bmc', 'gb200-bmc', and 'ast2700a0-evb'
 * ARM: 'virt' board now supports nested virtualization under KVM, CXL, and ACPI-based PCI hotplug
 * LoongArch: support for in-kernel irqchip
 * Microblaze: support for selecting the endianess of 'petalogix_s3adsp1800' machine type
 * RISC-V: ISA/extension support for atomic instruction fetch (Ziccif), 'Svrsw60t59b', and numerous other improvements/additions/fixes
 * RISC-V: support for Kunminghu CPU and platform
